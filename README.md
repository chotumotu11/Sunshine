An weather app I built while taking the udacity course

This is a weather app.I took "Developing Android Apps" course on Udacity.com and I wrote this app as a part of the course.
The Udacity's app in their own repository is outdated(as of now).Their app does not compile on Android Studio 1.5.Their course is also outdated.With
teachers notes added in some places.
So those who are unable to catch up with their course are welcome to use my code as a refrence.I had to read the android documentation 
extensively to write the app along with the videos.

Those who want to know how to add images to ListView using arrayAdapter can check out my app called ImageView.
